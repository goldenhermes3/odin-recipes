# odin-recipes
This is a project that is fully in HTML as part of the Odin Project Foundations HTML course. 
There are 4 webpages in total. A home page and 3 recipes.
In it I cemented what I learned in the course fully.
I learned: the html-boilerplate 
How to structure it the elements (title,body) and how to nest them
The text elements (headings, italics, bold, html comments)
Creating ordered and unordered lists
Lastly, placing links and images.
